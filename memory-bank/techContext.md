# Technical Context: Name Roulette Wheel

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Handles styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Implements the application logic and interactivity

### Key Features
- **CSS Animations**: Used for the wheel spinning effect and fireworks
- **CSS Variables**: Used for dynamic animation control
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamic creation and modification of HTML elements
- **Event Handling**: Capturing and responding to user interactions
- **Local Browser Execution**: No server-side components or dependencies
- **MediaRecorder API**: Used for video recording functionality
- **Particle Animations**: Used for fireworks celebration effect

## Development Setup
The application is built with vanilla web technologies and doesn't require any build tools or package managers. It can be developed with any text editor or IDE and viewed directly in a web browser.

### Development Environment
- Any modern text editor or IDE (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Modern web browser with developer tools (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- No build process or compilation required

### File Structure
```
/
├── index.html      # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css      # CSS styling and animations
└── script.js       # JavaScript functionality
```

## Technical Constraints

### Browser Compatibility
- Designed for modern browsers that support:
  - CSS Custom Properties (variables)
  - CSS Animations
  - ES6+ JavaScript features
  - Modern DOM APIs
  - MediaRecorder API (Chrome and Firefox for recording functionality)

### Performance Considerations
- Animation smoothness may vary on lower-end devices
- Complex wheel animations with many sections may impact performance
- CSS animations are hardware-accelerated where possible for better performance
- Fireworks animations may be resource-intensive on lower-end devices
- Video recording requires significant browser resources

### Scalability
- Designed to handle a reasonable number of names (tested up to 20)
- Visual clarity may decrease with too many names
- No persistent storage - data exists only during the session

## Dependencies
- No external libraries or frameworks
- No backend dependencies
- No API integrations

## Technical Decisions

### Why Vanilla JavaScript?
- Simplicity: No need for complex frameworks for this focused application
- Performance: Minimal overhead without unnecessary abstractions
- Portability: Can be deployed anywhere without build steps
- Learning: Demonstrates core web technologies without dependencies

### Why CSS Animations?
- Performance: Hardware acceleration for smooth animations
- Simplicity: Declarative approach to animations
- Control: Easy to manage with JavaScript
