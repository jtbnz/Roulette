# Active Context: Name Roulette Wheel

## Current Work Focus
The initial version of the Name Roulette Wheel application has been completed. The focus was on creating a functional and visually appealing roulette wheel that can randomly select a name from user inputs.

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic HTML structure with input fields and wheel container
- Implemented CSS styling for the wheel and animations
- Developed JavaScript functionality for:
  - Dynamic name input management
  - Wheel section creation with equal-sized segments
  - Spinning animation
  - Random selection algorithm
  - Result display with fireworks animation
  - Video recording and download functionality

## Active Decisions
1. **Visual Design**: Opted for a colorful wheel design with contrasting sections for better visibility
2. **Animation Approach**: Used CSS animations with JavaScript control for better performance
3. **Input Management**: Implemented dynamic addition/removal of input fields for flexibility
4. **Selection Algorithm**: Designed a fair random selection process with visual feedback
5. **Name Display**: Enhanced name visibility for wheels with 12 or fewer names
6. **Celebration Effect**: Added fireworks animation when a winner is selected
7. **Recording Feature**: Implemented video recording and download functionality

## Current Considerations
- The wheel design is optimized for a moderate number of names (5-12)
- Names are displayed clearly in the wheel segments when there are 12 or fewer names
- The animation timing is set to 5 seconds for a satisfying user experience
- Fireworks animation provides visual celebration when a winner is selected
- Video recording functionality allows users to save and share the spinning animation
- Mobile responsiveness is implemented but may need further testing
- No data persistence is implemented in this version

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
- Test the application across different browsers and devices
- Gather user feedback on the visual design and animation
- Verify the randomness of the selection algorithm

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Save/Load Functionality**: Allow users to save and load lists of names
2. **Custom Colors**: Let users customize the wheel's color scheme
3. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback during spinning and when result is shown
4. **History**: Track previous spins and results
5. **Share Results**: Add ability to share results via social media or messaging
6. **Multiple Wheels**: Support for creating and saving multiple different wheels
7. **Elimination Mode**: Option to remove selected names from subsequent spins
8. **Enhanced Video Recording**: Improve video quality and add editing options

### Technical Improvements
- Optimize animations for lower-end devices
- Improve text positioning for better readability, especially with long names
- Add keyboard navigation for better accessibility
- Implement local storage for saving user preferences
