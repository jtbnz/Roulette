# Name Roulette Wheel Project Rules

## Project Patterns

### Code Style
- HTML uses semantic elements for better accessibility
- CSS uses a clean, modular approach with specific class names
- JavaScript follows ES6+ conventions with clear function naming
- Comments are used to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions

### Color Scheme
- The wheel uses a vibrant, high-contrast color palette for visibility
- UI elements follow a green/blue theme for actions
- Red is reserved for removal/deletion actions
- Text uses dark colors (#333, #444) for readability

### Animation Patterns
- CSS animations are preferred for performance
- JavaScript controls animation timing and triggers
- Cubic-bezier easing is used for realistic motion
- Animation duration is set to 5 seconds for a satisfying experience
- Fireworks animation is used to celebrate the winner
- Particle animations provide visual excitement

### UI Patterns
- Input fields have clear placeholders
- Buttons have hover states for better UX
- The wheel is centered and prominently displayed
- Results are clearly highlighted
- Names are displayed in wheel segments when there are 12 or fewer names
- Recording functionality is provided with clear visual feedback

## User Preferences
- Simple, intuitive interface without unnecessary complexity
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Smooth, realistic animations
- Clear indication of results

## Implementation Details

### Wheel Construction
- The wheel is constructed using absolutely positioned div elements
- Each section is a div with rotation transform and clip-path for precise shape
- Segments are equal-sized regardless of the number of names
- Text is positioned using padding-bottom and transform
- Font size is dynamically adjusted based on the number of names
- Colors are assigned from a predefined array

### Random Selection
- Random selection uses Math.random() for the spin degree
- The final position is calculated based on the rotation angle
- The selection algorithm ensures every name has an equal chance

### Name Input Management
- Names are collected from input fields when spinning starts
- Empty inputs are ignored
- At least one name is required to spin
- Input fields can be dynamically added or removed

### Video Recording
- MediaRecorder API is used to capture the wheel animation
- Recording is triggered by a dedicated button
- Visual feedback indicates when recording is active
- MP4 format is used for better compatibility
- Download link appears automatically when recording is complete

## Known Challenges
- Text positioning on the wheel becomes challenging with many names
- Very long names may not display well on the wheel
- The wheel visual clarity decreases with too many sections
- Animation performance may vary across devices
- Video recording may not work in all browsers (primarily supported in Chrome and Firefox)
- Fireworks animation may be resource-intensive on lower-end devices

## Future Development Patterns
- Enhancements should maintain the simple, intuitive interface
- New features should be optional and not complicate the core experience
- Performance should be prioritized over visual complexity
- Mobile experience should be considered for all new features
